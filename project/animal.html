                    Exotic Animal World is a sanctuary for a variety of exotic animals, such as spiders, snakes, monkeys, meerkats,
                    scorpions, many species of bird and much more. All our animals were either donated by their previous owners, or
                    were
                    confiscated by local authorities and given into our care. Visitors to our sanctuary can see over 700 amazing
                    creatures
                    who are now all ambassadors for their species and carry the message: Appreciate, Don't Keep.

                <p>
                    The Great Yellow Mormon butterfly, also called the Asian Swallowtail, is known for its large size (up to 5 inches), its
                    sexual dimorphism with different colors for males and females, and its females' ability to mimic other less palatable
                    butterflies to avoid predators. Its larvae feed on citrus plants, and the butterfly is found in Southeast Asia,
                    including Borneo, Indonesia, and the Philippines.

                <p>
                    Ring-tailed lemurs are social, omnivorous primates from Madagascar known for their black-and-white ringed tails, "stink
                    fighting" to establish dominance, female-led troops, and daily sunbathing rituals. They communicate with a variety of
                    sounds and scent marking, are excellent climbers, and play a vital role as a symbol for endangered species in their
                    native habitat.
